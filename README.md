Arithmetic operations of big integer values.

**Files**

Arithmetic.cpp - Contains a main function that performs operations on two BigInteger lists<br>
BigInteger.cpp - implements a BigInteger ADT and includes access and manipulation functions. <br>
BigInteger.h - a header file that has the declarations of all functions used in BigInteger.cpp <br>
BigIntegerTest.cpp -Implements a BigInteger test that checks access and manipulation functions. <br>
List.cpp - implements a List ADT and includes access and manipulation functions. <br>
List.h - a header file that has the declarations of all functions used in List.cpp <br>
ListTest.cpp -Implements a List test that checks access and manipulation functions. <br>
README - has descriptions on how to run the script and files in the directory. <br>
Makefile - a script used to compile my file and clean the files after running. You can use it by writing “make {name of function}”. <br>
